# Team Lusito Presents: #
**The Open Game Libraries**, a set of Intuitive C++ libraries for creating games (released under the [zLib/PNG License](License.md)).<br />
We're focusing on performance, simplicity and being as lightweight as possible.

Alphabetic order:
  * [Audio](LibraryAudio.md) - OpenAL audio management ( loading sounds from ogg/wav, positioning them, setting attributes, etc. )
  * [Common](LibraryCommon.md) - Generic classes and objects for game development ( containers, text processing, etc. )
  * [Console](LibraryConsole.md) - Developer console window with support for Commands and variables
  * [Fable](LibraryFable.md) - Force, Axis, Buttons Light and Easy ( simply said gamepad input management )
  * [FileSystem](LibraryFileSystem.md) - Compressed zip file loading with a few neat features for multiplayer games.
  * [Font](LibraryFont.md) - Bitmapped Font loading and drawing ( Unicode + Kerning support )
  * [Gloot](LibraryGloot.md) - (OpenGL Object Oriented Toolkit), OpenGL window creation and keyboard/mouse input.
  * [Image](LibraryImage.md) - OpenGL image loading and saving
  * [Math](LibraryMath.md) - Vector, Matrix, Quaternions, Color, etc..
  * [Model](LibraryModel.md) - Loading 3D Models in a generic way, with import functions for various formats ( ASE, MD3, MD5, SKM, SMD )
  * [Shared](LibraryShared.md) - Shared parts to lighten the dependencies
