## Current Goals (unordered) ##
  * Get everything running on Linux
  * Get everything running on Mac
  * Finish documenting the interfaces
  * Complete the libraries

(The whole google code project is quite new so this is all work in progress information)

## Planned Libraries ##
(code already exists, just need to be redesigned to be a library):
  * [OpenGL GUI Library](http://code.google.com/p/open-game-libraries/wiki/Screenshots#GUI_Library_Work_In_Progress):
    * This will feature a skinned, variable size ingame GUI system much like Unreal Tournament (99)'s windowed GUI.
