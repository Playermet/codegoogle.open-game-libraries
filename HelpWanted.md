## Help Wanted ##

**We appreciate any kind of help:**
  * Constructive criticism
  * Naming suggestions
  * Bug reports
  * ..

But it would help us a lot if you actually worked on the code with us.<br />
That's why we are always looking for C++ developers.<br />

**This is what we expect from you:**
  * You have good knowledge of C++ and are interested in game development
  * You are reliable and speak English well enough to allow good communication
  * You are willing to write code under the [zLib/PNG License](License.md)
  * You write honest code ( no stealing from other developers and claiming it's yours )

**If you are interested**, send an email to **core {-at-} roughael.net** with the following content:
  * A little info on yourself, your prior experience, etc..
  * What part of the project you'd like to work on.

You can get more info on our IRC channel on irc.quakenet.org: #open.game.libraries<br />
A browser IRC client ( no plugins needed ) is available [here](http://webchat.quakenet.org/).
