#summary Math classes and functions, Color class and Hashing algorithms
#sidebar NavigationLibraries

== Description ==
The *Math* library was originally part of the [LibraryCommon Common Library].<br/>
I decided to make it a separate library and also added the Color and Hashing code.<br/>

== Classes and Features ==

 * Color ( stores and converts r, g, b, a values )

 * Math (Fast Game-specific Calculation):
  * Angles (pitch, yaw, roll)
  * Bounds (mins/maxs)
  * Matrix classes (2x2, 3x3)
  * Vector classes (2, 3, 4, 5, X dimensions)
  * Quat (quaternions)
  * Random number generator
  * Rect (for gui/hud stuff)
  * Lots of speed optimized Math functions & constants

== Dependencies ==
 * [LibraryShared Shared]
