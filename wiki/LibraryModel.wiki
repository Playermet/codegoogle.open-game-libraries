#summary Loading 3D Models in a generic way, with import functions for various formats

== Features ==

The idea is to have a model loader that can be used for any rendering engine.<br/>
It should be able to do static models as well as skeletal animated models.<br/>
It should have importers for the most popular formats, so there is no need for special plugins.<br/>
But it should also have a native binary model format for fast loading.<br/>
Currently importing works including the skeletal information, but it's only static models for now.

Model Import for:
 * ASE ( Unreal )
 * MD3 ( Quake 3 )
 * MD5 ( Doom 3 )
 * SKM ( QFusion )
 * SMD ( Halflife )
