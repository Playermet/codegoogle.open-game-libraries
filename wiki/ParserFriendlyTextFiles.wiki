#summary Definition of how text files are parsed

== About ==

*Parser Friendly Text Files* are UTF-8 encoded text files starting with a [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark Byte Order Mark].

== Comments ==
These files can contain single line comments and multiline comments:
{{{
// C++ style comments end with the next newline.
/*
   You can add multiline comments too
   Just like in C
*/
}}}

== Tokens ==
When these text files are parsed for tokens, a token ends when a whitespace (space, tab, newline) or a single character token is found.<br/>
Some tokens are single character, i.e. they end after the character itself: { } ( ) , ; $ = /<br/>
You can avoid this behavior and add for example full sentences by putting them into quotes.<br/>
Quotes can be done with either " or '. Depending on which you start with, it will search for the same char to end the string.

== Escape characters ==
You can escape some characters inside a quoted string:
 * \n creates a newline
 * \t creates a tab
 * \" creates a "
 * \' creates a '

== Example ==
The folling file:
{{{
 say( "hello \"world\"" /* you can't see me */ ); // can't see this either
}}}
..would result in these tokens:
 * say
 * (
 * hello "world"
 * )
 * ;
