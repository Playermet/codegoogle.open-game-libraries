*The Open Game Libraries*, a set of Intuitive C++ libraries for creating games (released under the [License zLib/PNG License]).<br/>
We're focusing on performance, simplicity and being as lightweight as possible.

 * [LibraryCommon Common] - Generic classes and objects for game development ( containers, text processing, etc. )
 * [LibraryConsole Console] - Developer console window with support for Commands and variables
 * [LibraryFable Fable] - Force, Axis, Buttons Light and Easy ( simply said gamepad input management )
 * [LibraryFileSystem FileSystem] - Compressed zip file loading with a few neat features for multiplayer games.
 * [LibraryFont Font] - Bitmapped Font loading and drawing ( Unicode + Kerning support )
 * [LibraryGloot Gloot] - (OpenGL Object Oriented Toolkit), OpenGL window creation and keyboard/mouse input.
 * [LibraryImage Image] - OpenGL image loading and saving
 * [LibraryMath Math] - Vector, Matrix, Quaternions, Color, etc..
 * [LibraryModel Model] - Loading 3D Models in a generic way, with import functions for various formats ( ASE, MD3, MD5, SKM, SMD )
