#summary Developer Console with customizable commands and variables
#sidebar NavigationLibraries

== Description ==
The *Console* library consists of 3 parts:
 * CVarSystem
 * CmdSystem
 * Console Window
  * Win32: A real window with a RichText log field and background image.
  * Linux: TTY Console (capable of remote control)
  * MacOS: Will probably be like Win32 too.

This offers the possibility of easily adding console commands, cvars and using them in runtime to develop/debug a game.<br/>
It will also be possible to access the log & autocompletion features for ingame use.
