#summary What's to be done
#sidebar NavigationLibraries

== Current Goals (unordered) ==
 * Get everything running on Linux
 * Get everything running on Mac
 * Finish documenting the interfaces
 * Complete the libraries

(The whole google code project is quite new so this is all work in progress information)

== Planned Libraries ==
(code already exists, just need to be redesigned to be a library):
 * [http://code.google.com/p/open-game-libraries/wiki/Screenshots#GUI_Library_Work_In_Progress OpenGL GUI Library]:
  * This will feature a skinned, variable size ingame GUI system much like Unreal Tournament (99)'s windowed GUI.
