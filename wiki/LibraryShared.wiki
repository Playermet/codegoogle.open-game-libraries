== Features ==

This is needed by all libraries, gives commonly used features like FileSystemCore interface ( in case you want to use your own filesystem ), SystemInformation and Threading

== Classes and Features ==
 * FileSystemCore Interface
  * Use this if you want to add your own filesystem instead of using the OG [LibraryFileSystem FileSystem]

 * Format (Typesafe text formatting)

 * Hash:
  * FNV( Compute 32 and 64 bit hashes of strings )
  * SecureHash ( Secure Hash Algorithm: SHA1 )

 * String (UTF-8)

 * SysInfo (retrieves CPU, RAM and OS information)
  * DateTime (Retrieve date & time)

 * Thread:
  * Basic Threading: (some thread helpers until c++0x is usable)
   * Condition
   * Mutex
   * Single-Writer-Multiple-Readers
   * Thread
  * LockFreeQueue (use for single producer and single consumer only)
  * LowLockQueue (multiple producer + multiple consumer)

 * Timer (for Profiling)
