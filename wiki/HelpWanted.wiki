== Help Wanted ==

*We appreciate any kind of help:*
 * Constructive criticism
 * Naming suggestions
 * Bug reports
 * ..

But it would help us a lot if you actually worked on the code with us.<br/>
That's why we are always looking for C++ developers.<br/>

*This is what we expect from you:*
 * You have good knowledge of C++ and interest in game development
 * You are reliable and speak enough english to allow good communication
 * You are willing to write code under the [License zLib/PNG License]
 * You write honest code ( no stealing from other developers and claiming it's yours )

*If you are interested*, send an email to *core {-at-} roughael.net* with the following content:
 * A little info on yourself, your prior experience, etc..
 * What part of the project you'd like to work on.

You can get more info on our IRC channel on irc.quakenet.org: #open.game.libraries
