#summary Common classes and algorithms for game development

== Description ==
The *Common* library is the first Library we worked on.<br/>
Back then it was named ogShared. We renamed it when refactoring the code.<br/>
This library contains various classes and functions for creating games.<br/>
This library contains various container types, math objects, string processing,<br/>
system information retrieval and other usefull things that make your everyday game code a lot easier.

== Classes and Features ==

 * Containers:
  * Allocator (allocates a list of objects instead of manually allocating each object)
  * CmdArgs (tokenizes a string into command-line arguments)
  * Dict/DictEx (fast access dictionaries for things like entity settings)
  * DynBuffer (easy buffer allocation/resizing/freeing)
  * HashIndex (Fast access to string based indices)
  * List classes
   * LinkedList (optimized for fast insert/remove)
   * List (list growing with a granularity for faster memory allocation)
   * ListEx (optimized for bigger items)
    * StringList (string lists)
  * StringPool/PoolString (store less copies of often used strings in memory)
  * Queue/Stack (push & pop lists)

 * Hash:
  * Hash ( Compute 32 and 64 bit hashes of strings )
  * SecureHash ( Secure Hash Algorithm: SHA1 )

 * Math (Fast Game-specific Calculation):
  * Angles (pitch, yaw, roll)
  * Bounds (mins/maxs)
  * Matrix classes (2x2, 3x3)
  * Vector classes (2, 3, 4, 5, X dimensions)
  * Quat (quaternions)
  * Random number generator
  * Rect (for gui/hud stuff)
  * Lots of speed optimized Math functions & constants

 * Text:
  * Lexer (UTF-8 text file parser)
  * Parsers:
   * DeclParser (.decl file parser)
   * XDeclParser (.xdecl file parser)
  * String (UTF-8)
  * TextStream (for formatting text)

 * Thread:
  * Basic Threading: (some thread helpers until c++0x is usable)
   * Condition
   * Mutex
   * Single-Writer-Multiple-Readers
   * Thread
  * LockFreeQueue (use for single producer and single consumer only)
  * LowLockQueue (multiple producer + multiple consumer)

 * Misc:
  * Color
  * SysInfo (retrieves CPU, RAM and OS information)
   * DateTime (Retrieve date & time)
  * Timer (for Profiling)
