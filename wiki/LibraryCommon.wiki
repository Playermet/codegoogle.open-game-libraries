#summary Common classes and algorithms for game development

== Description ==
The *Common* library is the first Library we worked on.<br/>
Back then it was named ogShared. We renamed it when refactoring the code.<br/>
This library contains various classes and functions for creating games.<br/>
This library contains various container types, math objects, string processing,<br/>
system information retrieval and other usefull things that make your everyday game code a lot easier.

== Classes and Features ==
( fixme: this is still a little outdated )

 * Containers:
  * List (list growing with a granularity for faster memory allocation)
  * ListEx (optimized for bigger items)
  * LinkedList (optimized for fast insert/remove)
  * Queue &amp; Stack (push &amp; lists)
  * StringList (string lists using ListEx)
  * CmdArgs (base class commandline functions will receive to get arguments)
  * StringPool &amp; PoolString (store less copies of often used strings in memory)
  * HashIndex (Fast access to string based indices)
  * Dict &amp; KeyValue (fast access dictionaries for things like entity settings)
  * DynBuffer (easy buffer allocation/resizing/freeing)
  * Allocator (for faster allocation of objects)

 * Math (Fast Game-specific Calculation):
  * Angles
  * Vec2/Vec3|3/Vec4|4/Vec5|5/VecX|X
  * Quat (quaternions)
  * Mat2/Mat3|33 (2x2/3x3 Matrices)
  * Rect (for gui/hud stuff)
  * Bounds (mins/maxs)
  * Random
  * Lots of speed optimized Math functions & constants

 * Text:
  * String (UTF-8)
  * Lexer (UTF-8 text file parser)
  * DeclParser (.decl file parser)
  * XDeclParser (.xdecl file parser)
  * Utilities (VA, FloatArrayToString and other useful utilities)

 * Misc:
  * Timer (For Profiling)
  * DateTime (Retrieve date &amp; time)
  * Color
  * SysInfo (retrieves CPU, RAM and OS information)
  * SecureHash (SHA algorithm)
