#summary Common classes and algorithms for game development
#sidebar NavigationLibraries

== Description ==
The *Common* library is the first Library we worked on.<br/>
Back then it was named ogShared. We renamed it when refactoring the code.<br/>
This library contains various classes and functions for creating games.<br/>
This library contains various container types, string processing,<br/>
and other usefull things that make your everyday game code a lot easier.<br/>
The math part of this library has been separated into a new Library [LibraryMath Math].

== Classes and Features ==

 * Containers:
  * Allocator (allocates a list of objects instead of manually allocating each object)
  * CmdArgs (tokenizes a string into command-line arguments)
  * Dict/DictEx (fast access dictionaries for things like entity settings)
  * DynBuffer (easy buffer allocation/resizing/freeing)
  * HashIndex (Fast access to string based indices)
  * List classes
   * LinkedList (optimized for fast insert/remove)
   * List (list growing with a granularity for faster memory allocation)
   * ListEx (optimized for bigger items)
    * StringList (string lists)
  * StringPool/PoolString (store less copies of often used strings in memory)
  * Queue/Stack (push & pop lists)

 * Text:
  * Lexer (UTF-8 text file parser)
  * Parsers:
   * DeclParser (.decl file parser)
   * XDeclParser (.xdecl file parser)
