== Current Status ==
( most finished ones first )

 * [LibraryImage Image] => 99% done, even the Doxygen comments are complete.
 * [LibraryFileSystem FileSystem] => Almost done. Doxygen comments are complete.
 * [LibraryFont Font] => Almost done, tho could need a rewrite to improve performance and does only work for OpenGL 2 right now. Doxygen comments are complete.
 * [LibraryAudio Audio] => Needs some polishing and some actual use to see if it needs to be adapted. Doxygen comments are complete for now tho.
 * [LibraryCommon Common] => Mostly done feature wise, Doxygen comments are still missing for most parts, since it's quite the biggest library to document.
 * [LibraryGloot Gloot] => A lot has been done, and the Win32 Part is nearly finished, the interface should be good for all platforms. Linux is in the works, Mac needs to be written from scratch. Doxygen comments are complete.
 * [LibraryFable Fable] => Win32 has support for DirectInput and XInput controllers, which work nicely already. Force Feedback API needs to be designed and implemented.
 * [LibraryModel Model] => Missing Animation loader, Skeletal code and Static import is working good so far.
 * [LibraryConsole Console] => Win32 code works quite good, but the API needs a lot of work to be useable. Linux TTY Console code is partially available, not included yet tho.
