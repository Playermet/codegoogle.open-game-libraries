#summary Small Introduction on how to get started with Win32 programming on the OG libraries:

== What you need ==
 * A C++ IDE, I'd recommend Visual C++ 2008, since there is also a free version ( Express Edition )
 * [http://vld.codeplex.com/ Visual Leak Detector 2.0b] ( you can do without by uncommenting the OG_VISUAL_LEAK_DETECTOR define in the Setup.h )
 * [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=3021d52b-514e-41d3-ad02-438a3ba730ba Direct-X SDK] ( If you want to use [LibraryFable Fable] )
 * [http://industriousone.com/premake Premake 4] (if you want to update/create project or make files)

== How to set up ==
 # Install your IDE
 # [http://vld.codeplex.com/documentation Install and set up Visual Leak Detector]
 # Install the Direct-X SDK and set it up the same way as VLD ( add include and library directories to your IDE )
 # If you don't use Visual Studio 2008, you'll need to create project/make files for your IDE. Check out Premake4 for how to do it.
