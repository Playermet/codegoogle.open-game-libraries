This shows by which libraries these dependencies are used by:
 * libJPEG and libPNG
  * Image
   * Font
 * zLib
  * libPNG
  * FileSystem
 * libOgg and libVorbis
  * Audio
 * OpenAL Soft
  * Audio
 * OpenGL
  * Gloot

  * Fable
 * Visual Leak Detector 2.0b
  * All OG Libraries
 * Common
  * Audio
  * Console

That Common is used by all OG Libraries does not mean that they are needed in the interface of those libraries too.<br/>
For example you don't need to use classes from the Common library to access the Gloot interface.<br/>
This shows which libraries actually use classes from the Common library in their interface:
 * Audio
 * Console
 * Model
