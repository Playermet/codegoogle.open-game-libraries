## Description ##
The **Math** library was originally part of the [Common Library](LibraryCommon.md).<br />
I decided to make it a separate library and also added the Color code.<br />

## Classes and Features ##

  * Color ( stores and converts r, g, b, a values )

  * Math (Fast Game-specific Calculation):
    * Angles (pitch, yaw, roll)
    * Bounds (mins/maxs)
    * Matrix classes (2x2, 3x3)
    * Vector classes (2, 3, 4, 5, X dimensions)
    * Quat (quaternions)
    * Random number generator
    * Rect (for gui/hud stuff)
    * Lots of speed optimized Math functions & constants
